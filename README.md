# flutter_background_location (Android only)

A Flutter plugin to get location updates in background.

**I developed this for a personal project to get location updates on Android (I don't own a mac), So it'll just work with android.**

## Use this package as a library in your flutter Application

**1:** Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_background_location: ^0.0.3
```

**2:** You can install packages from the command line:

```bash
$ flutter packages get
```

Alternatively, your editor might support flutter packages get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

**3:** Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_background_location/flutter_background_location.dart';
```
